# Challenge

“Chindōgu means unusual/rare/precious (chin) tool (dōgu). It originated from Japan, by an inventor by the name of Kenji Kawakami. Sometimes it is known by another term, while recognised as a different name in other parts of the world: unuseless inventions, weird tools, kludge, jugaad, Système D.

Despite the rather humorous approach to innovation, the practice of chindōgu can be seen as an exercise in creativity, unhindered by the penalty of impracticality. This impracticality might be physiological, ethical, cultural, social, oftentimes just simply too embarrassing to use. However, one can argue that chindōgu embraces a kind of hopeful, even childish optimism that any problem can be resolved, and the mistakes we make in such quick attempts are hopefully worthy lessons.

Given the pandemic across the world, borders have been closed for so long. Now that frontiers are again open, we are all itching to get back out into the world, near and far. This brief requires you to address travel, or (alternatively) lack thereof. Take into consideration the logistics, fears, needs of the traveller and use a “Chindogu” approach to create a whimsical ‘travel’ device.

Design an Arduino based based solution that adopts the philiosophy of Chindōgu. Come up with an interactive contraption that supports, resolves, reflects or critiques on the various challenges associated with travel. Be as absurd and poetic, even nonsensical, as you want it to be, or if you wish, focus on the functional.”

# Design

The idea behind the design is that a ring works as the input device with which the wearer can select his/her current mood and depending on this the colour of the earrings (or other weareble device/jewelry) changes. A second input device is the mask, which will detect if the wearer is smiling underneath it. Whenever a smile is being detected the earrings will light with more intense brightness and a little jingle will be played to add sound to the interaction.

### Component selection

### INPUT
#### Selecting mood: Potentiometer
To select a mood, I decided to use a potentiometer as input. Potentiometers are variable resistors and change their resistance when the dial is being turned. Depending on how far the dial is turned, a different voltage amount is applied to the pin which can then be read as an analog value that can be mapped to PWM (pulse width modulation) in order to for example change the color of a LED (Instructables, 2017).
#### Detecting touch: wires as capacitive sensors
Instead of using a complex a complex facial sEMG (surface electromyography) system, as suggested in the research part about detecting smiles, I decided to use capacititive touch sensors that can detect touch when the cheeks are raised underneath the mask while smiling. Capacitive sensors can sense the electrical capacitance of the human body (Arduino, n.d.). A simple wire can be used as a capacitive touch sensor. I decided to use 2 wires, to detect both the right and left cheek.

### OUTPUT
#### Display varying colors: RGB LED
As I want to be able to display a full range of colors to reflect the wearer’s mood, I decided to use an RGB LED. An RGB LED consists of three colour LEDs: red, green
and blue. By mixing those together, many other colors can be created (Arduino Project Hub, n.d.). 
#### Play a sound: active piezo buzzer
To play sound, when a smile is detected, a sound output device is needed. For this, an active piezo buzzer is chosen. Metal film inside the buzzer is vibrating which
causes the resulting sound waves (Campbell, 2021).

# Walkthrough

![Walkthrough](walkthrough.png)

Emma is wearing the devices, which are the mood ring, the mask and the earrings. Depending on how she feels, Emma can change the mood on her ring by sliding it around her finger. Right now she is feeling confident, so she is setting the mood to that (1). Now her earrings light up in the corresponding colour with 50% brightness (2). The capacitive sensors inside her mask are identifiying whether Emma is smiling, by checking whenever both sensors are exceeding the set threshold (3). When that is the case, the earrings light up with 100% brightness and a little happy jingle is being played (4). The lighting up and jingle last for a short time, before returning to the previous state with 50% brightness (5). Whenever Emma feels that her mood changes, she can set the ring to a new status (6), and her earrings will change color accordingly (7). This will also reflect when Emma is detecting laughing again, then the earrings will light up in the new mood colour (8).
