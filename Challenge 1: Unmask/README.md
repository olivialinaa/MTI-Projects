# Challenge

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have all become accustomed to wearing masks in public and private settings. While we can appreciate the added safety this practice brings, undeniably the down-side is that we may find it more difficult to express ourselves, and to 'read' the expressions of others, both because of attenuated (masked) facial expressions, and the increased muffling of our voices. Additionally, masks can prevent the hard of hearing from lip-reading.

What opportunities are there for the use of interactive, artefact-based or wearable technology to enhance our human-human communication [while we continue to use masks to protect ourselves and others from airborne viruses]?

Design an Arduino based wearable or standalone design object that can display a range of indicators of mood, emotion, or 'reaction' such as agreement, disagreement, joy, sadness, confusion, anger, disapproval, salutation etc... The wearable or object can be a mask, sculptural object, jewelry, a hat, scarf etc... [if you are unsure, please ask]

As with all assignments, pushing the boundaries of the brief will potentially add bonus points. Ask yourself these questions and see where you can add depth and functionality to your project:

1. Can you think of an original input system? (hands-free? gestural? other?)

2. Could you incorporate sound or sound-detection into the system? (voice recognition is beyond the scope of this assignment)

3. Can you actually build your prototype / circuit? If not a prototype with the actual circuit, can you make a paper prototype or a 3d model of your wearable / object at size 1:1 for demonstration?

4. Have you constructed/documented a 'cognitive walkthrough' of the prototype?

Note: For this first challenge you DO NOT need to present an actual fabricated physical prototype, nor do you have to buy additional sensors; you just have to speculate on the build. Even though there is no need to actually fabricate or build the wearable, you should design it  — with sketches and/or renders &/or paper prototypes. You can speculate on the ergonomics of your design, the human-computer-interface (HCI) as well as the materials and methods of fabrication. Consider also possible power sources, how/where will they be incorporated?

You DO need to either actually or virtually build your circuit design, to test your programming. Therefore, your code and circuit should be plausible — you are encouraged to use TinkerCAD to develop and test this Challenge. You are encouraged to independently seek out new code commands, especially to extend the brief.

# Design

The idea behind the design is that a ring works as the input device with which the wearer can select his/her current mood and depending on this the colour of the earrings (or other weareble device/jewelry) changes. A second input device is the mask, which will detect if the wearer is smiling underneath it. Whenever a smile is being detected the earrings will light with more intense brightness and a little jingle will be played to add sound to the interaction.
